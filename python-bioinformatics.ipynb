    "- This allows external commands to be run, but can be pretty wordy compared to a simple: \"echo -n \"1234\" | wc -m\" (see below example)\n",
    "- So sometimes in pipeline development, it can make sense to use Shell over Python for ease of both writing & reading, while bringing in Python for more advanced data manipulations & operations\n",
    "- Keep in mind that in the workflow paradigm Nextflow, you can integrate the two. Each process code block can have a shebang for setting the code interpreter (if none is added, default is Shell)\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can have a Nextflow Shell code block, and call Python as an external programme from within it, pointing at a script file, e.g.,: `python scripts/function_x.py`"
