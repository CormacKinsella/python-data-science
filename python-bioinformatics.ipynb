    "- Keep in mind that in the workflow paradigm Nextflow, you can integrate the two. Each process code block can have a shebang for setting the code interpreter (if none is added, default is Shell)\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can have a Nextflow Shell code block, and call Python as an external programme from within it, pointing at a script file, e.g.,: `python scripts/function_x.py`"
