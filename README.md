# Python for data science

>Note this repo is a work in progress

## Jupyter notebooks covering several topics in Python basics, data science, and bioinformatics

### To run:

1. Install VSCode and the VSCode Python plugin, the latter allows work with Jupyter notebooks

2. Clone the repo with GitHub CLI:

```
gh repo clone CormacKinsella/python-data-science
```

3. Set up the Conda environment for software dependencies. [Get conda here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers). To create, activate, and check the environment:

```
conda env create -f python-data-science.yml
conda activate python-data-science
conda list
```

4. Open any of the notebooks within VSCode, and explore code interactively!
