## Python for data science

### Jupyter notebooks covering several topics in Python basics, data science, and bioinformatics

#### To run:

Clone the repo, e.g., with GitHub CLI:

```
gh repo clone CormacKinsella/python-data-science
```

- For installation of software dependencies, a conda environment file is provided (python-data-science.yml). [Get conda here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers). To create, activate, and check the software environment:

```
conda env create -f python-data-science.yml
conda activate python-data-science
conda list
```

- Install VSCode and the VSCode Python plugin, the latter allows work with Jupyter notebooks
